# Chrome-History-Analyzer

This is a python file to read in the local Chrome history database on your machine and then either print to console or plot a bar graph using matplotlib of your 10 most visited sites along with their site count.

## Getting Started

All you need to do to get started is to install the prerequisites and run the main BrowserHistory.py file on your local machine using any form of Python interpreter.

**This will not work if Chrome is open at the time, it will tell you the sqlite3 database is locked.**

### Prerequisites

You will need:
* Chrome (not a fresh install, the local history db needs to be available)
* SQLite3
* Matplotlib
